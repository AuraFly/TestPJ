## Project Inspiration
 The basis of this idea came from Natalya Colburn. As a software develoiper who teaches Jazzersize on the side, she wanted a way to be able to help the community and keep scheduling and invoicing for all teachers to be fair and accurate. Thus came about J.I.M.. With J.I.M., users can login in and add classes and make sure that they can get paid!
